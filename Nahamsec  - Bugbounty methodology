1. Overview
2. Asset Discovery
3. Content Discovery
4. Automation
5. Digital Dumpster Diving
6. Real Life Examples


1. Overview
  Why?
	Self improvement
	Networking
	My career was built/boosed thanks to it
	Competition makes it more fun
	Extra cash
Recon
	Spend more time on doing recon then anything else, you'll learn alot
	We all leak out paswords on Github some time
	6.20 in is a great flow chart
	Shodan
	Certspotter (nice API, free)
	cert.sh (great API and webinterface, wildcard)
	OSINT (Open Source Intellegence) 

2. Asset Discovery
	In short,
		Find websites
		Port scan
		Look for interesting files and directories
		
3. Content Discovery
	webscreenshoot.py goes to a webpage and takes a screenshot if it responds, set a max respons time!
	Robots.txt often has good information
		
	Good directory search programs	
		dirbuster
		gograber
		gobuster
		dirsearch (best one)
	Always archive your reports

4. Automation
	lazys3.py (written by Ben and a Co-worker)
	bucketeer.sh
	Pro tip, build certspotter, dirsearch and webscreenshot together, win!
	
5.  Digital Duspster Diving
	Looking for credentials, API tokens and authorization headers
	Search for variable name, list of examples 25:40
	Get your hands on old data, waybackmachine.org, sometimes people forgett to clean old shit up
	JS parser, tool for cleaning up Javascript
	Look at Trello
  
6.   Real Life Examples
	Snapchat, not secured their Jenkins
	AirBNB, don't let users users submit just any get querry
	Dumster diving, finding FTP-credentials on github, also, tokens are fun and dangerous
